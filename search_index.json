Resource\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA tiny but powerful system for managing 'resources': data that is persisted to\nremote servers.\n✓ Removes nearly all \"boilerplate\" code for remotely-stored data✓ Tracks the status (pending, failed, success, etc.) of every request✓ Encourages normalized state✓ Works well with APIs that adhere to standardized formats, such as JSON API✓ Works well with APIs that don't adhere to standardized formats, too✓ Integrates well with lots of technologies: HTTP, GRPC, streams, redux-observable, redux-saga, and more✓ Microscopic file size (2kb gzipped!)\nInstallation\nTo install the latest version:\nnpm install --save redux-resource@2.0.0-beta\nTable of Contents\n\nQuick Start\nThe quick start guide is a quick overview of basic Redux Resource usage.\n\nIntroduction\nThe introduction explains why this library exists, and also explores\nalternative solutions.\n\nGuides\nThe guides explain the concepts in this library. The guides also contain a\nnumber of examples.\n\nRecipes\nRecipes are recommended patterns and best practices that you can use in your\napplication. They assume that you understand all of the material in the\nGuides.\n\nEcosystem Extras\nRedux Resource provides officially maintained bits of code that make\nworking with the library even better.\n\nFAQ\nAnswers to frequently asked questions.\n\nAPI Reference\nDescribes the API of all of the exports of Redux Resource.\n\n\nQuick Start\nFollow this guide to get a taste of what it's like to work with Redux\nResource.\nFirst, we set up our store with a \"resource reducer,\" which is a reducer that\nmanages the state for one type of resource. In this guide, our reducer will\nhandle the data for our \"books\" resource.\nimport { store, combineReducers } from 'redux';\nimport { resourceReducer } from 'redux-resource';\n\nconst reducer = combineReducers({\n  books: resourceReducer('books')\n});\n\nconst store = createStore(reducer);\n\nOnce we have a store, we can start dispatching actions to it. In this example,\nwe initiate a request to read a book with an ID of 24, then follow it up with an\naction representing success. There are two actions, because requests usually\noccur over a network, and therefore take time to complete.\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\n// This action represents beginning the request to read a book with ID of 24.

Because\ncommunicating with remote servers requires sending messages over a network,\nreading and writing this state does not happen instantly. The requests take\ntime, and they may sometimes fail.\nThese network requests are often made as a result of a user's action within the\napplication. It's a developer's responsibility to provide feedback to the user\nabout these requests. When using Redux, this means writing reducers that change\nyour store's state tree based on the status of these requests. If your\napplication has many resources, you can run into problems when you write these\nreducers by hand.\nFor one, simply figuring out what information needs to be tracked can be\ndifficult to figure out. Request tracking is a complicated problem.\nWhen you do figure out something that works, it may be implemented slightly\ndifferently for different resources in your state tree. This inconsistency will\npropagate to your view layer. Code bases that are not consistent are more\ndifficult to maintain.\nAdditionally, tracking all of this data for every request requires writing a lot\nof reducer code. You may omit writing some of that code to save on time. This\ncontributes to inconsistency, and also gives you, the developer, less\ninformation to use when providing feedback to users.\nRedux Resource is intended to solve these problems. It provides a system of\norganizing information about request state in a consistent way. It also comes\nwith reducers that keep track of as much information as possible about every\nrequest made to remote servers, so that you don't have to.\nUse Redux Resource to have more time to build great interfaces, rather than\nwriting boilerplate Redux code.\n"},"docs/introduction/core-concepts.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/core-concepts.html","title":"Core Concepts","keywords":"","body":"Core Concepts\nUnderstanding these core concepts is useful when using Redux Resource.\nResources\nA resource is an entity that you interact with in your application. For\ninstance, if your web application manages a public library, then you might have\ntwo resources: \"books\" and \"members.\"\nEach instance of a resource has a unique ID, which differentiates it from other\nresources of the same time. They typically also have attributes, such as \"name\"\nor \"releaseYear.\"\nResources don't necessarily need to represent tangible objects. They can be more\nabstract things, too, such as \"workflows\" or \"permissions.\"\nIn Redux Resource, each resource will be kept in its own\nslice of\nyour store. Within that slice, all of the resources of a single type are kept in\nan object, where the key of the object is the resource's ID. This looks like the\nfollowing:\n{\n  resources: {\n    24: {\n      // Attributes of book 24\n    },\n    100: {\n      // Attributes of book 100\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nResource Metadata\nIn addition to an ID and attributes, resources have \"metadata\" about them, which\nis additional information about a resource that is useful for your interface.\nFor instance, if your interface displays a list of books that the user can\nselect by clicking checkboxes, then the information about which books are\nselected would be metadata about the books resource.\nA rule of thumb is that metadata is any data about a resource that is not\npersisted to a remote server.\nIn Redux Resource, all metadata is stored on an object. This meta object,\nlike the resources object, has resource IDs as its keys, and has values that are\nmetadata. An example is:\n{\n  meta: {\n    24: {\n      // Metadata for book 24\n    },\n    100: {\n      // Metadata for book 100\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nLists\nOften, applications need to keep track of ordered groupings of resources. In\nRedux Resource, this is done through a concept named \"lists.\"\nLists in your store are an array of resource IDs. A resource's lists might look\nlike the following:\n{\n  lists: {\n    searchResults: [10, 233, 4, 50],\n    shoppingCart: [10, 409],\n  }\n}\n\nAs a user interacts with your application, Redux Resource provides a straightforward\nAPI to keep lists up-to-date.\nCRUD Operations\nThere are four interactions you can have with a resource: you can create them,\nretrieve them, update them, or delete them. These four operations are\ncollectively known as\nCRUD.\nCRUD Operation Requests\nFor many applications, resources are stored in an external system, and\nCRUD operations with the resources occur over a network. These interactions are\ncalled \"requests.\" Typically, they are HTTP requests.\nBecause requests occur over a network, they do not happen instantly.\nThey might take awhile to complete, and they don't always succeed.\nIn Redux Resource, this information is represented as one of four \"statuses\":\n\nNULL: the request hasn't begun yet\nPENDING: the request has started, but has not yet finished\nFAILED: the request was unsuccessful\nSUCCEEDED: the request was successful\n\nWhen you use Redux Resource, the status of every CRUD operation that you\nmake in your application is stored in your application's state tree.\nFor requests that target specific resources by their ID, the request status will\nbe associated with those resources. So if you had one resource with an ID of 24,\nthen your metadata for that resource will start off looking like this:\n{\n  meta: {\n    24: {\n      createStatus: 'NULL',\n      readStatus: 'NULL',\n      updateStatus: 'NULL',\n      deleteStatus: 'NULL'\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nFor requests that don't target a resource (or resources) by ID, you can assign\nthe request a \"name.\" A name is just a string that you can use to look up that\nrequest's status.\nBy storing this information at such a granular level, Redux Resource provides\na robust foundation from which you can build truly great user experiences. And\nyou don't even need to write any boilerplate.\n"},"docs/introduction/similar-projects.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/similar-projects.html","title":"Similar Projects","keywords":"","body":"Similar Projects\nThis isn't the only library that aims to reduce boilerplate when it comes to\nmanaging resources.

Each of these slices will store information about a single type of\nresource, separate from your other types of resources.\nIn the rest of this guide, we will be talking about the structure of a single\nstate slice. If you're not using combineReducers, then the slice will instead\nbe your entire state tree.\nInitial State\nThe initial state slice has the following shape:\n{\n  resources: {},\n  meta: {},\n  lists: {},  \n  requests: {}\n}\n\nAs you dispatch Action types, Redux Resource will make changes to these\nvalues in a predictable way. We will cover what goes inside each of these pieces\nin this guide.\nResources\nAll of your resource data will be available in the state slice's resources\nproperty. This is an object of resources of a single type.\nRedux Resource enforces a\nnormalized structure to\nyour data: each individual resource can be found in exactly one place in the\nstate tree.\nFor instance, if your server returns the following JSON response body:\n{\n  data: [\n    {\n      id: 23,\n      firstName: 'Sally'\n    },\n    {\n      id: 100,\n      firstName: 'Jane'\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nthen your state slice will end up looking like this:\n{\n  resources: {\n    23: {\n      id: 23,\n      firstName: 'Sally'\n    },\n    100: {\n      id: 100,\n      firstName: 'Jane'\n    }\n  },\n  meta: {\n    // Resource metadata here\n  },\n  lists: {\n    // Resource lists go here\n  },\n  requests: {\n    // Named requests here\n  }\n}\n\nThe resources object allows you to quickly look up resources given their ID.\nYou may be wondering how ordering from the server is preserved. You use \"lists\"\nfor this, which is a feature that we will cover shortly.\nKeep in mind that Redux Resource doesn't care about the specific format that\nyour server sends the data back in. You just need to make sure that the resources\nyou pass into Redux Resource have an id attribute.\nResource Metadata\nMetadata about each of the resources in your state slice's resources array\nis stored under the meta object of the slice. The meta object is similar to\nthe resources object, in that the keys are individual resource IDs.\nMetadata includes information about requests, such as whether the resource is\nbeing updated, or deleted. You can store additional, application-specific\nmetadata here, such as whether or not a resource is \"selected\" in your UI.\nRedux Resource comes with built-in metadata for each resource, representing\nthe status of any CRUD request related to that resource. This built-in metadata\nlooks like the following:\n{\n  createStatus: 'NULL',\n  readStatus: 'NULL',\n  updateStatus: 'NULL',\n  deleteStatus: 'NULL'\n}\n\nThese four keys represent the four CRUD actions. The values of the keys are\none of the four request statuses – \"NULL\", \"PENDING\", \"SUCCEEDED\", or\n\"FAILED\", representing the status of any requests to CRUD that resource.\nYou're encouraged to store additional, application-specific metadata for your\nresources, too. For instance, a common feature of applications is to allow a\nuser to \"select\" resources, before performing some action on the selection.\nOne thing you could do is store a selected boolean on the metadata, so\nthat it would look like:\n{\n  createStatus: 'NULL',\n  readStatus: 'NULL',\n  updateStatus: 'NULL',\n  deleteStatus: 'NULL',\n  selected: false\n}\n\nLet's look at an example to see how this metadata changes as the user interacts\nwith your application. Consider an application where a user can select resources\nfrom a list, and then take action on their selection (such as updating or\ndeleting the selected items). If the user has selected two resources, with\nIDs 2 and 23, then their state slice will look like the following:\n{\n  resources: {\n    // The resources themselves are in here.\n  },\n  meta: {\n    2: {\n      selected: true,\n      createStatus: 'NULL',\n      readStatus: 'NULL',\n      updateStatus: 'NULL',\n      deleteStatus: 'NULL'\n    },\n    23: {\n      selected: true,\n      createStatus: 'NULL',\n      readStatus: 'NULL',\n      updateStatus: 'NULL',\n      deleteStatus: 'NULL'\n    },\n    100: {\n      selected: false,\n      createStatus: 'NULL',\n      readStatus: 'NULL',\n      updateStatus: 'NULL',\n      deleteStatus: 'NULL'\n    }\n  },\n  lists: { ... },\n  requests: { ... }\n}\n\nIf the user then clicks a \"Delete\" button to initiate the deletion of these\nresources, the slice would then look like this:\n{\n  resources: {\n    // The resources themselves are in here.\n  },\n  meta: {\n    2: {\n      selected: true,\n      createStatus: 'NULL',\n      readStatus: 'NULL',\n      updateStatus: 'NULL',\n      deleteStatus: 'PENDING'\n    },\n    23: {\n      selected: true,\n      createStatus: 'NULL',\n      readStatus: 'NULL',\n      updateStatus: 'NULL',\n      deleteStatus: 'PENDING'\n    },\n    100: {\n      selected: false,\n      createStatus: 'NULL',\n      readStatus: 'NULL',\n      updateStatus: 'NULL',\n      deleteStatus: 'NULL'\n    }\n  },\n  lists: { ... },\n  requests: { ... }\n}\n\nAny time that you have metadata associated with a single item, you can add it\nto that resource's meta object to keep track of it.\nKeep in mind that you don't need to store any additional metadata here. For\ninstance, in the above example, if you'd rather have a selectedIds property\ndirectly on your state slice instead, then you could do that. Just know that\nthe option is there to store your own, additional metadata per-resource within\nmeta.\nLists\nLists are a way to keep track of ordered subsets of resources. The resources\nsection of the slice (described above), is useful in that it provides a single\nlocation for all resources of a single type to live. It's also useful because\nit provides quick lookups for all resources, given their ID.\nThe resources object does not account for two things that applications\ncommonly need:\nThe first is keeping track of ordering. JavaScript objects are unordered, so they\nare unable to keep track of, say, the order that a server returns your resources in.\nThe second is keeping track of different groups of resources. Imagine an\napplication for managing books, where the user has a list of books returned\nby a search result, and also a shopping cart with a list of books.\nBecause these are the same resource (books), they belong in the same slice.\nBut there are two different \"groupings\" of them, and they may have a different\norder.\nLists lets you do both of these things. Lists allow you to keep track of an ordering\nthat the server returns to you, and you can have as many lists as you'd like.\nUsing the above example, let's see what those lists might look in the state slice:\n{\n  resources: {\n    // The resources themselves are in here.\n  },\n  meta: { ... },\n  lists: {\n    shoppingCart: [24, 100, 10],\n    searchResults: [9, 34, 782, 24, 30]\n  },\n  requests: { ... }\n}\n\nRequests\nThe last piece of the slice is called \"requests.\" Any time that you initiate a\nCRUD operation request, you can assign it a name. A name is just a string,\nsuch as \"createBook\". Redux Resource associates the following data about\nthe request with your named request:\n\nthe lifecycle status (pending, failed, and so on) of the request\nwhich resources were returned by the request\n\nThe primary use case for named requests is to track statuses in your\napplication. In the above section on meta, we used the fact that some\nrequests target specific resources (by their ID) to track the request\nstatus on the resource's metadata.\nWe can't always do that, though. Consider a request that searches for books\nby the title that the user has typed in. There's no specific ID associated\nwith this request, so we can't store information about the request with a\nresource's metadata. By giving requests like these a name, we can keep track\nof their lifecycle, too.\nThe structure of a slice with named requests looks like the following:\n{\n  resources: {\n    // The resources themselves are in here.\n  },\n  meta: {\n    // The resource meta is in here.\n  },\n  lists: {\n    // Lists are in here\n  },\n  requests: {\n    createBook: {\n      ids: [],\n      status: 'PENDING'\n    },\n    shoppingCart: {\n      ids: [1, 20, 53],\n      status: 'SUCCEEDED'\n    },\n    recentBooks: {\n      ids: [20, 71, 100, 102, 103, 120],\n      status: 'SUCCEEDED'\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNow that you know how data is stored, you're ready to start building\nRedux Actions to modify this data.\n"},"docs/guides/tracking-requests.html":{"url":"docs/guides/tracking-requests.html","title":"Tracking Requests","keywords":"","body":"Tracking Requests\nDisplaying feedback about CRUD operations requires knowing the status of its\nrequest: is it pending, failing, succeeded? This is what we mean by \"tracking\"\na request. The status of a request can be used to display feedback to the user\nof your application, such as showing loading indicators or error messages.\nThere are two ways to track CRUD operation requests in Redux Resource:\ntracking the status on some resources' metadata, and using a named request.\nYou'll always use at least one of these when performing CRUD operations.\nSometimes, you might use both.\nResource Metadata\nSome CRUD operations directly target a resource, or a set of resources, by their\nID. For instance, if the user is fetching a book with ID 23, then this action is\ndirectly targeting the book with ID of 23. Likewise, deleting books with IDs\n100, 101, and 102 is a request that is targeting these three resources directly.\nAnytime that you have a set of IDs when the action begins, you have the option\nto track the CRUD operation status on the targeted resource's metadata. You can\ndo this by passing a resources array with the start action.\nLet's look at an example. The action that represents beginning a read request\nof a book with ID 24 looks like the following:\n{\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceName: 'books',\n  resources: [24]\n}\n\nWhen this is dispatched, your slice's metadata will be updated like this:\n{\n  meta: {\n    24: {\n      createStatus: 'NULL',\n      readStatus: 'PENDING',\n      updateStatus: 'NULL',\n      deleteStatus: 'NULL'\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIn your view layer, you can then use\ngetStatus to access this state in a\nconvenient way.\nThe rule of thumb is:\nYou can track CRUD operation requests on resource metadata anytime you have an\nID when you fire the \"start\" action type.\nThe above condition isn't always met. In those situations, you use named requests\nto track requests.\nNamed Requests\nIndividual requests can be given a name. You can use named requests to track the status\nof any CRUD operation request in your application, whether or not you have IDs at the\nstart of the action.\nThe following information is stored about each named request in your state\nslice:\n{\n  status: 'NULL',\n  ids: []\n}\n\nwhere status is the request status, and ids are any associated resource IDs\nwith this request.\nInformation about named requests is stored in the requests section of your\nstate slice. For instance, if you dispatch a pending action for a request with\nthe name create, then your state slice would look like:\n{\n  resources: {\n    // resources in here\n  },\n  meta: {\n    // resource metadata in here\n  },\n  lists: {\n    // lists are in here\n  },\n  requests: {\n    create: {\n      status: 'PENDING',\n      ids: []\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nYou can use getStatus to conveniently\naccess and use the status of a named request in your view layer.\nTwo common examples of when to use a named request include:\n\nRead many requests, where the user is passing some sort of query to filter a\nlarge list by\n\nCreating requests, when the user does not provide an ID for the new resource\n\n\nbut do note that they can be used for any CRUD operation, even when IDs are\nincluded in the start action.\nIt might seem strange to associate a name with a request, but we find that it\nworks out well in practice. For instance, for creating a book, you might use the\nname \"create\" or \"createBook\". And for fetching the latest movies, you\nmight use \"latestMovies\". It turns out that there's usually a name that makes\nsense for each request in your application.\nFor more on named requests, check out the guide on\nNamed Requests.\nUsing Statuses\nYou now know the two locations that request statuses can be stored.

In Redux Resource, these\nasynchronous CRUD operations are represented as a sequence of two Redux Actions.\nFirst, there is a \"start\" action, which updates your store to reflect that the\nCRUD operation is in a \"pending\" state. This is later followed by an end action,\nwhich updates the status to reflect the outcome of the request.\nFor instance, the sequence of action types for a successful read request is the\nfollowing:\nREAD_RESOURCES_PENDING ⇨ READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED\nThis notion of a start and end action will continue to be referenced throughout\nthese guides. In particular, remember that the start action sets the request\nstatus to 'PENDING', and that it is dispatched right before the request begins.\nThe redux-thunk middleware is\nrecommended for making action creators for these CRUD operations.\nAction Attributes\nAll actions have a single required value, resourceName, which is the name\nof the resource that is being affected. The simplest action, then, looks\nsomething like this:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceName: 'books'\n});\n\nThis action type isn't very useful, however.

Consequently, this action is a no-op.\nTo reflect a request status in the state tree, you need to supply at least one\nof these two values in your action: a resources array, or a request, which\nis a name to represent the request.\nresources\nA resources array represents the resources being affected by the action.\nIt can be an array of IDs, such as [1, 2, 3], or an array of resource objects,\nsuch as\n[\n  {\n    id: 1,\n    name: 'Brian',\n    phone: '444.444.4444'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 2,\n    name: 'Sarah',\n    phone: '222.222.2222'\n  }\n]\n\nYou can even mix the two. When it comes to a resources array, the important\npart is that the objects have some id. This associates the action with some\nresources.\nYou may be wondering when you might use the object form versus the shorthand\nform. There are two guidelines to remember, one for the start action, and one\nfor the end action.\nFor the start action, provide IDs, if you have them.\nFor the end action, provide the full resource definitions, if you have them.\nIf you don't, but you do have IDs, then provide those.\nLet's look at an example.\nIf you're reading a single resource, such as a book, then you might access that\nbook from your backend service with its ID. In this situation, you will have an\nID at the time that you dispatch the start action, so we include that ID in\nthe action's resources array:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceName: 'books',\n  resources: [23]\n});\n\nWhen the request succeeds, you now have more detailed information about this\nbook to add to your store. So you would include the full book definition in the\nsuccess action's resources:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED,\n  resourceName: 'books',\n  resources: [{\n    id: 23,\n    releaseYear: 2015,\n    author: 'Jane M. Goodfellow',\n    title: 'A History of Canada'\n  }]\n});\n\nWhenever a resources array is supplied, Redux Resource will update the\nmeta for each resource in that array.\nThe \"success\" action types also have special behavior with the resources\narray. For creates, reads, and updates, your state's resources object will be\nupdated to reflect any new data. For successful deletes, the state for that\nresource will be changed to be null, and the resource will be removed from the\nids array of all lists.\nIt isn't always possible to provide an array of resources in your action. For\ninstance, if the user is searching for books by entering a title, you couldn't\nknow which books will be returned until after the request has completed.\nTo keep track of the resources for requests like these, you need to use named\nrequests.\nrequest\nSupplying a request will track the status of this request under the requests\nproperty of your store.\nFor instance, if your interface allows users to search for a books resource, you\nmight dispatch the following action:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceName: 'books',\n  request: 'booksSearch',\n  query: 'Lord of the Flies'\n});\n\nResources are primarily used to keep\ntrack of the request status. For more, refer\nto the guide on named requests.\nlist\nFor create and read CRUD operations, you can supply a list to add the resources\nreturned from the operation with one of the lists in your slice.\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceName: 'books',\n  list: 'mostPopular',\n  query: 'Lord of the Flies'\n});\n\nTo learn more about lists, refer to the lists guide.\nOther CRUD Action properties\nThe following CRUD Action attributes are all optional.\n\nmergeResources (Boolean): When an action results in resources being\nupdated in the store, this determines if the new data is merged with the old,\nor if it replaces the old data. Defaults to true. This only has an effect\non successful read, write, and update Actions.\n\nmergeMeta (Boolean): This is like mergeResources, but for metadata.\nDefaults to true. This property works with actions with any of the CRUD\naction types.\n\nmergeListIds (Boolean): When a list is supplied, this lets you control\nwhether or not the new list of IDs replaces or gets merged into the existing\nlist of IDs for that list. When true, it will protect against duplicate\nIDs being added. Defaults to true. This only applies for successful read\nand write Actions that have a list specified.\n\n\nAction Creators\nThe core Redux Resource library does not include action creators, but there\nis a library, Redux Resource XHR, that includes\naction creators.\nYou're also free to build your own action creators. For examples, refer to the\nfour CRUD guides:\n\nReading Resources\nUpdating Resources\nCreating Resources\nDeleting Resources\n\nUsing the Action Types\nOne of this library's exports are these CRUD action types. You can use them in\nyour application by importing them like so:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\n\nFor a complete list of all of the action types, refer to the\nAction Types API Reference.\n"},"docs/guides/named-requests.html":{"url":"docs/guides/named-requests.html","title":"Named Requests","keywords":"","body":"Named Requests\nYou can give requests a name, which is a string that is associated with\nthat request. Naming a request is useful because it provides you with a\nkey that you can use to look up that request's status.\nNamed requests are most frequently used when you're unable to, or prefer\nnot to, track the status of a request on a resource's metadata.\nFor instance, if you're creating a book, you might use the name \"create\"\nfor that request. In your store slice, each named request is found under the\nrequests key. In the example of create, a slice might look like:\n{\n  requests: {\n    create: {\n      status: 'SUCCEEDED',\n      ids: [24]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nwhich would mean that the create request succeeded, and the resource with ID\nof 24 was created.\nWhy name a request\nNaming your request can be used to track the request's status. For more on why\ntracking request statuses is useful, refer to the\nTracking Requests guide.\nUsing a named request\nUsing a named request is straightforward: add the request property to\nthe Actions for a CRUD operation.\nimport { actionTypes } fom 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceName: 'books',\n  request: 'search'\n});\n\nYou should use the same name for the \"lifetime\" of the request. For instance,\nif you use a particular name for the \"pending\" action, then you will want\nto use that same name for the \"success\" action, too.\nWhen to Use Named Requests\nA rule of thumb for using named requests is:\nUse a named request anytime that you do not have an ID, or a list of IDs, when you\ndispatch a \"pending\" action.\nFor example, if you attempt to read a book with ID of 23, then you will have\nan ID when you dispatch the \"read pending\" action (the ID is 23). So a\nnamed request may not be necessary in this situation.\nOn the other hand, if you were to make a request to your backend for the list\nof books that were just released this past week, then you wouldn't have any IDs\nat the time that you dispatch the \"read pending\" action. So you should use a\nnamed request in this situation.\nYou're free to use a named request in addition to passing IDs, too. For instance,\nif you're deleting 3 particular books, you might prefer to use a named request\nto track that, rather than looking at one of the book's metadata (which may\nseem awkward).\nAn Example\nWhen a named request is used, the status of the associated request is stored in\nyour state, and you can access it with\ngetStatus:\nimport { getStatus } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nconst state = store.getState();\nconst searchStatus = getStatus(state, 'books.requests.search.status');\n// => Returns the following object:\n//\n// {\n//   null: false,\n//   pending: true,\n//   failed: false,\n//   succeeded: false\n// }\n//\n\nWhen the request succeeds, you dispatch the following action:\nimport { actionTypes } fom 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED,\n  resourceName: 'books',\n  request: 'search',\n  // `newResources` are the list of books that were returned by the server\n  // for this query.\n  resources: newResources\n});\n\nNow when you call getStatus for this named request, you get the following object:\n{\n  null: false,\n  pending: false,\n  failed: false,\n  succeeded: true\n}\n\nAvoid Dynamic Names\nAvoid using dynamic names. Common dynamic names that developers use are:\n\nserializing a search to create unique names for each search\nserializing a new resource's attributes to create a unique name for each\ncreated resource\nputting a resource ID in a name for some reason or another\n\nDynamic names are more error-prone, harder to reason about, and often unnecessary,\nso you should strongly consider if you need them before using them.\nInstead, stick to \"static\" strings for names such as \"create\", or\n\"readBooks\". Most applications don't need to distinguish requests any\nfurther because they typically only allow one of these \"types\" of requests\nto be active at a single time. Keep it simple!\n"},"docs/guides/request-statuses.html":{"url":"docs/guides/request-statuses.html","title":"Request Statuses","keywords":"","body":"Request Statuses\nWe now know that when the CRUD action types are dispatched, Redux Resource\nwill set some metadata about those requests for us in the store. In this guide,\nwe will cover how you can use this state in your view layer.\nIn these examples, we will be writing React components using react-redux. Do\nkeep in mind that nothing in Redux Resource requires React: if you're using Redux\nwith any other view layer, then this library will work just as well.\ngetStatus\nOne of the exports of this library is\ngetStatus. This function facilitates\nusing Redux Resource data to build your interfaces, and for this reason it\nwill likely be the function of Redux Resource that you use the most.\nLet's look at an example. Let's say we have a page that displays details about\na book. We might write the following component:\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux';\nimport { getStatus } from 'redux-resource';\n\nexport class BookDetails extends Component {\n  render() {\n    const { book, readStatus } = this.props;\n\n    return (\n      \n        {readStatus.pending && 'Loading...'}\n        {readStatus.failed && 'There was an error.'}\n        {readStatus.succeeded && (\n          \n            \n              {book.title} ({book.id})\n            \n            \n              {book.releaseYear}, {book.author}\n            \n          \n        )}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nfunction mapStateToProps(state, props) {\n  // A user can pass a `bookId` into this Component to view the book's data\n  const bookId = props.bookId;\n  const readStatus = getStatus(state, `books.meta.${bookId}.readStatus`, true);\n  const book = state.books.resources[book.id];\n\n  return {\n    book,\n    readStatus\n  };\n}\n\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps)(BookDetails);\n\nYou can see how the object returned from getStatus makes a render function\nvery expressive. It's also convenient that there aren't any checks for\nexistence here, even though our data is nested in our store: the API of\nRedux Resource provides you with very predictable data.\nAggregating Statuses\nOften times, the data displayed on a single page comes from multiple sources.\nWhenever possible, we recommend using multiple getStatus calls in these\nsituations, so that you can display information to the user as it becomes\navailable. This way, if one endpoint is slow, or if the request fails entirely,\nthe rest of the interface isn't affected by it.\nWith that said, we know this isn't always possible. Sometimes, you simply\ndo need to wait for multiple requests to resolve before there is anything\nuseful to show on the page.\nYou can use getStatus to aggregate these calls together into status. The\nAPI for this is as follows:\nimport { getStatus } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './get-store';\n\nconst state = store.getState();\n\nconst aggregatedStatus = getStatus(state, [\n  'books.meta.23.readStatus',\n  'books.requests.getBookComments.status'\n], true);\n\nThe rules of aggregation work as follows:\n\nIf any status is failed: true, then the group is failed: true.\nIf no status is failed: true, but at least one is pending: true, then the\ngroup is pending: true.\nIf all statuses are succeeded: true, then the group is\nsucceeded: true.\n\nAt most, only one of these values will ever be true.\nIf treatNullAsPending (the third argument, see below) is false, then all three\nvalues will be false if all of the request statuses in the state tree are\n\"NULL\".\ntreatNullAsPending\nThe third argument to getStatus is a Boolean called treatNullAsPending. It\ndetermines whether a request status of \"NULL\" will count as pending or not.\nConsider an interface that loads a particular book when the page loads. Right\nat page load, there will always be a short moment when the request hasn't begun,\nyet your store has been set up. At this moment, the request status for this read\nwill have a value of \"NULL\".\nIf you don't pass true, then there will be a \"flash of no content\" unless\nyou explicitly check for the \"NULL\" status yourself. To avoid this, pass\ntreatNullAsPending as true, and getStatus will instead consider that to be a\npending state.\nThe default value of treatNullAsPending is false.\nThe Rule of Thumb\nThere is a rule of thumb for using treatNullAsPending:\n\nFor requests that happen when the page loads, pass treatNullAsPending as true\nFor requests that happen as a response to a user's action (such as clicking a\nbutton), pass treatNullAsPending as false\n\n"},"docs/guides/lists.html":{"url":"docs/guides/lists.html","title":"Lists","keywords":"","body":"Lists\nWhen you read or create resources, they get added to the resources object\nwithin your state slice. This is useful for quick lookups of a single\nresource, but there are a few things this doesn't let you do:\n\nkeep track of resource ordering\nmanage subsets of resources\n\nLists allow you to do both of these things. We will consider these two use cases\nmore in-depth in this guide, but first, let's cover how to use lists.\nUsing Lists\nTo use a list, add the list property to your\nCRUD operation actions.\nimport { actionTypes } fom 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceName: 'books',\n  list: 'mostPopular'\n});\n\nYou only need to specify a list for create or read actions. Because lists\nonly store IDs, they get resource updates automatically. And successful\ndeletes will remove the deleted resources from all lists automatically.\n\nNote: If you specify a list for other actions, nothing bad will happen. It's\n  just not necessary.\n\nWhy Use Lists\nThere are two use cases for lists. Let's look at them.\nOrdering\nIn your state slice, resources aren't stored in any order: they're just\nkeys on the resources object. Frequently, applications will need to preserve\nthe order that the server returns a list of resources in. For instance, if you\nmake a request for a list of books ordered by popularity.\nLists are an array of IDs of resources, and they retain server side ordering.\nWhen the request to retrieve the most popular books succeeds, your state slice\nmay look like something like:\n{\n  lists: {\n    mostPopular: [1002, 24, 100, 234]\n  },\n  resources: {\n    // Resources and their attributes are in here\n  },\n  meta: {\n    // Metadata about resources is stored in here\n  },\n  requests: {\n    // Named requests go here\n  }\n}\n\nOrdered Subsets of Resources\nIn the earlier guide on State Structure, we\ncovered that all resources of the same type are kept in a single object. This is\na good thing, but it introduces a problem: how do you keep track of \"groups\" of\nthe same resource?\nConsider a web application shows a list of recently released\nbooks, as well as a user's shopping cart of books. We know that in the state\ntree, all of these books will be stored in one object, but we will want to show\nthem as two different lists in the interface.\nBecause you can have any number of lists, you can use lists to keep these\nresources separate.\nReplacing List IDs\nBy default, subsequent successful requests with the same list will merge\nthe old list IDs with the new. You can outright replace the old list with the\nnew by passing mergeListIds: false in your action. For instance:\nimport { actionTypes } fom 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED,\n  resourceName: 'books',\n  list: 'mostPopular',\n  mergeListIds: false,\n  // `newResources` is the list of books that were returned by the server\n  // for this query.\n  resources: newResources\n});\n\nAvoid Dynamic Lists\nAs with named requests, dynamically-named lists are harder to reason about.\nWe strongly recommend that you use statically-named lists whenever possible.\nThere may be valid reasons to use dynamically-named lists, but they are few\nand far between.\n"},"docs/guides/reading-resources.html":{"url":"docs/guides/reading-resources.html","title":"Reading Resources","keywords":"","body":"Reading Resources\nRedux Resource provides four action types for\nreading resources.

It uses the\nredux-thunk middleware and the\nlibrary xhr for making requests.\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\nimport xhr from 'xhr';\n\nexport default function createBook(bookDetails) {\n  return function(dispatch) {\n    dispatch({\n      type: actionTypes.CREATE_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n      resourceName: 'books',\n      request: 'create'\n    });\n\n    const req = xhr.post(\n      '/books',\n      {\n        json: bookDetails\n      },\n      (err, res, body) => {\n        if (req.aborted) {\n          dispatch({\n            type: actionTypes.CREATE_RESOURCES_NULL,\n            resourceName: 'books',\n            request: 'create'\n          });\n        } else if (err || res.statusCode >= 400) {\n          dispatch({\n            type: actionTypes.CREATE_RESOURCES_FAILED,\n            resourceName: 'books',\n            request: 'create'\n          });\n        } else {\n          dispatch({\n            type: actionTypes.CREATE_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED,\n            resourceName: 'books',\n            request: 'create',\n            resources: [body]\n          });\n        }\n      }\n    );\n\n    return req;\n  }\n}\n\n"},"docs/guides/deleting-resources.html":{"url":"docs/guides/deleting-resources.html","title":"Deleting Resources","keywords":"","body":"Deleting Resources\nRedux Resource provides four action types for\ndeleting resources. They are as follows:\n\"DELETE_RESOURCES_PENDING\"\n\"DELETE_RESOURCES_FAILED\"\n\"DELETE_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED\"\n\"DELETE_RESOURCES_NULL\"\n\nEach request will always begin with an action with type\nDELETE_RESOURCES_PENDING. Then, one of the other three action types will be\nused to represent the resolution of that request. Use the requests in the\nfollowing way:\n\nDELETE_RESOURCES_FAILED: Use this if the request fails for any reason. This\ncould be network errors, or any\nHTTP Status Code\ngreater than 400.\nDELETE_RESOURCES_NULL: Use this is the request is aborted.\nDELETE_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED: Use this when the request was successful.\n\nUsing Named Requests\nBecause you usually know the ID of the resources that you're deleting, you\ntypically don't need to use named requests for delete operations. The metadata\nfor the delete request can just be stored on the resource metadata directly.\nSometimes, you might do a bulk delete of, say, 5 resources. You're more than\nwelcome to just choose one of those 5 resources, and use its metadata to track the\ndelete for the other 4 resources. However, if this doesn't sound like a good system\nto you, then you can also use a named request to track that bulk action.\nSuccessful Deletes\nWhen an action of type DELETE_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED is dispatched, any resources\nincluded in the action will be removed from the resources array of your state\ntree. They will also be removed from the ID array of any list.\nThe meta for each of the resources will be reset to the default metadata,\nexcept for deleteStatus, which will be set to \"SUCCEEDED\".\n\nNote: Keep in mind that this means that a resource's metadata will never\n  completely go away with the built-in reducers. If we handled this cleanup for\n  you, then you would never get the successful status for delete requests!\nFor most applications, this won't be a problem, and you can just leave the\n  metadata in your state tree. If your application involves deleting many, many\n  resources, you may want to write a plugin to clear\n  out old, unused metadata.\n\nRedux Resource XHR\nRedux Resource XHR \nprovides a collection of out-of-the-box action creators that you can use to \ndelete resources.

We recommend using the\nreact-redux library to handle\nusing Redux with React.\nIf you're using react-redux, there are a few patterns that we find ourselves\nusing frequently with Redux Resource.\nUsing mapStateToProps\nWe recommend placing your calls to getResources\nand getStatus within\nmapStateToProps. That way, you can access this information from any of the\ncomponent's lifecycle methods, without needing to compute them for each method.\nFor example:\nimport { getResources, getStatus } from 'redux-resource';\n\nfunction mapStateToProps(state) {\n  const searchedBooks = getResources(state, 'books', 'searchResults');\n  const searchStatus = getStatus(state, 'books.requests.getSearchResults.status');\n\n  return {\n    searchedBooks,\n    searchStatus\n  };\n}\n\nThese methods are generally performant enough when used in this way. If\nyou do see performance issues due to these calls, we recommend using\nreselect, which will further reduce the\nnumber of times that the values are computed. You probably don't won't need to\ndo this, though – only do it if you're sure that you need to.\nType Checking with Prop Types\nRedux Resource Prop Types exports a number of helpful prop types for common props\nthat you'll pass into your React Components. Read the Redux Resource Prop Types\ndocumentation for more.\nUsing Statuses\nThe return value of getStatus is an object with four boolean values on it,\nrepresenting each of the four request statuses. Because only one of those values\nis ever true, you can write expressive code in your render function to handle\nthe different request statuses.\nrender() {\n  const { searchedBooks, searchStatus } = this.props;\n\n  return (\n    \n      {searchStatus.pending && ('Loading...')}\n      {searchStatus.failed && (\n        \n          There was an error running your search.\n          \n            Retry.\n          \n        \n      )}\n      {searchStatus.succeeded && (\n        \n          {searchedBooks.map(book => (\n            \n              {book.title} - {book.releaseYear}\n            \n          ))}\n        \n      )}\n    \n  );\n}\n\nDetermining When a Request Succeeds\nSometimes, you want to know the exact moment that a request succeeds. Redux\ndoesn't provide an event system for things like this (for better or worse), so\nyou must instead check the previous state with the next state to determine when\na request changes from one status to the other.\nWe recommend performing this check within componentWillReceiveProps. This\nmight look like:\nimport { getResources, getStatus } from 'redux-resource';\n\nclass BooksList extends Component {\n  render() {\n    // Render contents here\n  }\n\n  // Let's log to the console whenever a search result succeeds\n  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {\n    const { searchStatus } = this.props;\n\n    // Bail if the request wasn't previously pending (requests can only succeed\n    // if they've been started!)\n    if (!searchStatus.pending) {\n      return;\n    }\n\n    const nextSearchStatus = getStatus(nextProps, 'books.requests.getSearchResults.status');\n\n    if (nextSearchStatus.succeeded) {\n      console.log('The search request just succeeded.');\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nfunction mapStateToProps(state) {\n  const books = state.books;\n  const searchStatus = getStatus(state, 'books.requests.getSearchResults.status');\n\n  return {\n    searchStatus,\n    books\n  };\n}\n\n"},"docs/guides/plugins.html":{"url":"docs/guides/plugins.html","title":"Plugins","keywords":"","body":"Plugins\nPlugins are a way to add or change the behavior of a\nresourceReducer.\nThere are two main use cases for plugins:\n\nadding additional functionality to the reducer, such as custom action types\n\nextending the behavior of the reducer for the built-in action types\n\n\nAdding Additional Functionality\nYou will often want to use more action types than the built-in action types.\nFor instance, if your interface allows users to \"select\" resources with\ncheckboxes, then you want may to add support for some selection action types.\nPlugins allow you to add support for custom action types to support features\nlike this.\nExtending Built-in Action Types\nThe notion of a \"request\" in Redux Resource is intentionally generic. It's\nnot tied to any specific protocol, such as HTTP. What this means is that when\na request fails, the only information that you have is that the request\nfailed, and not that it failed with, say, a 404 status code. That's because 404\nstatus codes are a feature of HTTP requests. Consequently, if you're using HTTP\nrequests, then you'll likely want to use a plugin to give you more information\nabout the requests that you make.\nSimilarly, if you're using GRPC, or some other system, then you'll want a plugin\nto give you more information about those types of requests and responses.\nFurthermore, if you're using a system like JSON API, then you can use plugins to\nadd support for features such as relationships or response metadata.\nThere's an official HTTP Status Codes plugin\nthat makes working with HTTP requests even better.\nOfficially maintained plugins for other common protocols are on our to do list, but\nin the meantime, we've done our best to make it straightforward to write your own.\nUsing a Plugin\nYou define plugins per-resource when you call\nresourceReducer. The second\nargument to that function is an options options, and within it you can pass\nplugins as an array:\nimport resourceReducer from 'redux-resource';\nimport somePlugin from './some-plugin';\nimport anotherPlugin from './another-plugin';\n\nexport default resourceReducer('books', {\n  plugins: [somePlugin, anotherPlugin]\n});\n\nWriting a Plugin\nA plugin is a function that with the following signature:\n(resourceName, options) => reducerFunction\n\nWhere resourceName and options are the same values that you passed to\nresourceReducer.\nThe return value, reducerFunction, is also a function. This returned function\nhas the same signature as a Redux reducer:\n(previousState, action) => newState\n\nwhere state is the value of the state after running it through the built-in\nreducer and action is the action that was dispatched.\nThe simplest plugin then (which doesn't do anything), would look like this:\nfunction myPlugin(resourceName, options) {\n  return function(state, action) {\n    return state;\n  }\n}\n\nIf you prefer using arrow functions, you might choose to write this like so:\nconst myPlugin = (resourceName, option) => (state, action) => state;\n\nThis plugin isn't very exciting, so let's look at more realistic examples.\nCustom Action Types\nLet's build a plugin that lets a user select resources from a list. The code\nfor this plugin looks like this:\nimport { setResourceMeta } from 'redux-resource';\nimport myActionTypes from './my-action-types';\n\nexport default function(resourceName, options) {\n  return function(state, action) {\n    // Ignore actions that were dispatched for another resource type\n    if (action.resourceName !== resourceName) {\n      return state;\n    }\n\n    if (action.type === myActionTypes.SELECT_RESOURCES) {\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        meta: setResourceMeta({\n          resources: action.resources,\n          meta: state.meta,\n          newMeta: {\n            selected: true\n          },\n          initialResourceMeta: options.initialResourceMeta\n        })\n      };\n    } else if (action.type === myActionTypes.UNSELECT_RESOURCES) {\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        meta: setResourceMeta({\n          resources: action.resources,\n          meta: state.meta,\n          newMeta: {\n            selected: false\n          },\n          initialResourceMeta: options.initialResourceMeta\n        })\n      };\n    } else {\n      return state;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nYou would then use this plugin like so:\nimport { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';\nimport { resourceReducer } from 'redux-resource';\nimport selectResources from './plugins/select-resources';\n\nlet store = createStore(\n  combineReducers({\n    books: resourceReducer('books', {\n      plugins: [selectResources]\n    }),\n  })\n);\n\nChanging Built-In Action Type behavior\nInterestingly, the built-in behavior of Redux Resource is itself just a plugin.\nAdditional plugins are run after this built-in plugin runs, so you can write\nplugins that make further adjustments to the state after the built-in plugin. In\nthe following plugin, we set a property on the store anytime a successful read\noccurs:\nexport default function(resourceName, options) {\n  return function(state, action) {\n    // Only take action if the resource name of the Action matches the\n    // resource this plugin is registered for\n    if (action.resourceName !== resourceName) {\n      return state;\n    }\n\n    if (action.type === 'READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED') {\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        readSucceeded: true\n      };\n    } else {\n      return state;\n    }\n  };\n}\n\nCustomizable Plugins\nYou can write plugins that can be customized per-slice by taking advantage of\nthe fact that the resourceReducer's options are passed into plugins. For\ninstance, if you had a plugin like the following:\nexport default function customizablePlugin(resourceName, options) {\n  return function(state, action) {\n    if (options.useSpecialBehavior) {\n      // Perform a computation\n    } else {\n      // Do some other computation here\n    }\n  };\n}\n\nthen you could trigger the special behavior by passing\nuseSpecialBehavior: true as an option to resourceReducer:\nimport resourceReducer from 'redux-resource';\nimport customizablePlugin from './customizable-plugin';\n\nexport default resourceReducer('books', {\n  plugins: [customizablePlugin],\n  useSpecialBehavior: true\n});\n\nIf this API isn't to your liking, then you can also just wrap the plugin itself\nin a function, like so:\nexport default function(pluginOptions) {\n  return function customizablePlugin(resourceName, options) {\n    return function(state, action) {\n      if (pluginOptions.useSpecialBehavior) {\n        // Perform a computation\n      } else {\n        // Do some other computation here\n      }\n    };\n  };\n}\n\nwhich would be used in the following way:\nimport resourceReducer from 'redux-resource';\nimport customizablePlugin from './customizable-plugin';\n\nexport default resourceReducer('books', {\n  plugins: [\n    customizablePlugin({ useSpecialBehavior: true})\n  ]\n});\n\nYou may dislike this approach due to the tripley-nested functions. That's fine,\nbecause either way works. Use the version that makes the most sense to you.\nBest Practices\nBecause plugins are so similar to reducers, you can use a switch statement\nand support multiple action types within each plugin. This is usually a\ngood thing, but be mindful of keeping each plugin limited to a single\nresponsibility.\nFor example, in the above example of a plugin for selecting resources, it\nsupports two Action types – one for selection, and one for deselection. This\nplugin encapsulates that one responsibility, and it isn't responsible for any\nother Action types.\nWe recommend having a plugin for each distinct responsibility.\n"},"docs/recipes/":{"url":"docs/recipes/","title":"Recipes","keywords":"","body":"Recipes\nThese are patterns and snippets of code that will help you when using\nRedux Resource in an application.

One feature of HTTP\nrequests is that they can be cancelled.\nAs a rule of thumb, for each request that you make in your application, there\nwill always be one situation where you will want to cancel that request to\nprevent bugs.\nWhy do it\nCanceling requests prevents race conditions. A race condition occurs when you\nhave two requests in flight at the same time, but your code is written such that\none must resolve before the other. As you may know, requests can resolve\nin any order, which leads to the bugs.\nA common pattern we've seen in Redux applications is this:\n\nwhenever a request completes, an action is dispatched\na reducer responds to that action, updating the state\na view renders using the latest data from the state\n\nThis pattern isn't bad – it's great! You just need to be aware that\nit can lead to bugs when requests aren't cancelled.\nLet's look at two examples that demonstrate the problem.\nExample: A Typehead\nConsider a \"typeahead\" component that allows a user to type to search for books.\nEven when the user's input is debounced, there are situations where two (or more)\nactive requests can be in flight. The user can type, wait a moment for a request\nto send, then type one key to fire off a second request. If the backend response\ntime is slower than the debounce time, then two search requests will be in\nflight at once.\nBecause the requests can complete in any order, it is possible that the user's\nearliest search results will return after their latest search results. If\nyour code is written such that the last-received search results are displayed,\nthen that can lead to the wrong search results being shown.\nCanceling a previous request resolves this problem, as it means that only one\nsearch request will ever be in flight at a time, and it will be the user's most\nrecent search. If you're using an action creator that returns a native\nXMLHttpRequest object, such as the action creators in Redux Resource XHR, then\nyour code may look like this:\nclass Typeahead extends Component {\n  searchBooks: function(query) {\n    if (this.searchBooksRequest) {\n      this.searchBooksRequest.abort();\n    }\n\n    this.searchBooksRequest = this.props.searchBooks(query);\n  }\n}\n\nAnother tip is to cancel any requests when the component unmounts. If the search\nresults aren't needed when the component unmounts, then letting a request complete\nwill still update your state tree, which can cause unnecessary renders in your\napplication. Canceling requests in componentWillUnmount might look something\nlike:\nclass Typeahead extends Component {\n  componentWillUnmount: function() {\n    if (this.searchBooksRequest) {\n      this.searchBooksRequest.abort();\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nExample: Pagination\nConsider a page of an application that displays books. Often, long lists of\nresources will be paginated, and a user can move between the pages by clicking a\n\"next\" or \"previous\" button.\nA race condition can occur when the user clicks the buttons too fast, or when\nthe backend service is slow. If your view layer renders out the results of the\nlatest response, then it's possible that they could see the results from the\nwrong page.\nSimilar to the search example above, ensuring that only a single page of data\nis being fetched at once is the solution.\nThe solution is the same as the typeahead example:\n\ncancel any existing page-change requests before starting a new one\nconsider if it makes sense to cancel the request when the component\nunmounts\n\nA common feature of these bugs is that they depend on unreliable network\nconditions, so they don't usually come up in a development environment. This\nmakes them easy to ignore, but they're still worth protecting against.\nHow to do it\nThere are many different tools developers use to make requests. In this section,\nwe will go through how to cancel requests using some of the most common tools.\nXMLHttpRequest\nIn browsers, the native way to cancel a request is to call the abort method\non an XMLHttpRequest.\nconst myRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();\nmyRequest.open('GET', 'books');\n\nmyRequest.abort();\n\nxhr\nThe xhr library simplifies the creation of\nXHR objects. Because it returns a native XMLHttpRequest object, canceling\nrequests with xhr is the same as when you use the native XMLHttpRequest\nconstructor.\nimport xhr from 'xhr';\n\nconst request = xhr.get('/books/23', (err, res) => {\n  if (req.aborted) {\n    console.log('Request cancelled');\n  }\n});\n\nrequest.abort();\n\nRedux Resource XHR for \nRedux Resource uses xhr for requests.\nThese action creators return a native XHR object, so you can use the abort\nmethod to cancel those requests.\nfetch\nThe native fetch\nmethod is a tool for making requests that returns a\nPromise.\nNative Promises cannot be cancelled, so we do not recommend using fetch with\nRedux Resource.\naxios\naxios is a Promise-based approach to HTTP\nrequests that supports cancellation. It uses a system of canceling Promises\ncalled \"Cancel Tokens,\" which is based off of\na withdrawn cancelable Promises proposal.\nTo see how to cancel axios requests, refer to\nthe axios documentation.\nBluebird\nBluebird is Promise implementation that supports\ncancellation using an onCancel method.\nRefer to the Bluebird documentation\nfor specifics on the onCancel method.\nRxJS Observables\nRxJS Observables are another tool that can be used to make HTTP requests. The\ntakeUntil\nmethod can be used to cancel RxJS requests.\nIf you happen to be using redux-observable, refer to that library's documentation\nfor\na recipe for request cancellation.\nAlternatives\nYou don't always need to cancel requests. Two other options are:\n\nPrevent the user from performing an action more than once. For instance, in\nthe search example, you could prevent the user from typing if a search of theirs\nis already in flight. And in the pagination example, you can disable the\n\"next\" and \"previous\" buttons until the new page loads. In these examples,\nthis approach is clearly a subpar experience, but sometimes it does make\nsense. For instance, disabling a \"Delete\" button for a book once the user\nclicks it once, or disabling a \"Buy\" button after the user confirms a\npurchase.\n\nYou could write code to keep track of which request's response is the correct\none to display. We generally find it to be simpler to cancel requests instead.\n\n\nThere may be other options, too, and different approaches may make more sense to\nyou based on the situation.\n"},"docs/recipes/unauthorized-responses.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/unauthorized-responses.html","title":"Unauthorized Responses","keywords":"","body":"Unauthorized Responses\nSome applications log users out after a certain period of time. For single page\napps, this usually presents itself as requests to the backend suddenly failing\nfor the logged-out user. This can occur when the user leaves the application\nopen in their browser over night, for instance.\nA common UX pattern is to display a notification to the user when this occurs,\nso that they can log back in. This recipe describes one way that you can detect\nwhen a user is logged out, so that you can notify them however you see fit.\nYour server\nThe backend that you interface with needs to provide a consistent representation\nof the user being logged out.\nIf your API uses proper\nHTTP status codes,\nthen this means that the responses will have a 401 status code.\nThe rest of this guide will assume that the backend returns a 401 HTTP status\ncode, although this same system works for other representations, too.\nAction Creators\nWhenever an unauthorized response from the backend is returned in your CRUD\naction creators, include the status code in the action that you dispatch.\nIf you're using Redux Resource XHR,\nthen the entire res object will be attached to the action. You can access the\nstatus code at action.res.statusCode.\nIf you're not using Redux Resource XHR, then your code may look\nsomething like:\nexport function readBook(id) {\n  return function(dispatch) {\n    dispatch({\n      type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n      resourceName: 'books',\n      resources: [id]\n    });\n\n    request('/some-url', (err, res) => {\n      if (err || res.statusCode >= 400) {\n        dispatch({\n          type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_FAILED,\n          resourceName: 'books',\n          resources: [id],\n          res\n        });\n\n        return;\n      }\n\n      // Check to see if the request was cancelled, or if it succeeded, then\n      // dispatch the appropriate action here.\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nReducer\nThe final step is to write a reducer that updates the state tree whenever\nthese failed actions occur. Here is an example reducer that does this:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\n\nconst {\n  READ_RESOURCES_FAILED,\n  UPDATE_RESOURCES_FAILED,\n  CREATE_RESOURCES_FAILED,\n  DELETE_RESOURCES_FAILED\n} = actionTypes;\n\nexport default function reducer(state = false, action) {\n  const isFailedAction = action.type === READ_RESOURCES_FAILED ||\n    action.type === UPDATE_RESOURCES_FAILED ||\n    action.type === CREATE_RESOURCES_FAILED ||\n    action.type === DELETE_RESOURCES_FAILED;\n\n  if (isFailedAction && action.res.statusCode === 401) {\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  return state;\n}\n\nBefore an unauthorized response has been received, this reducer will return\na state of false.  When a logged-out response is received, then the reducer\nwill update the state to be true.\nYou'll want to use this reducer with\ncombineReducers:\nimport { combineReducers } from 'redux';\nimport unauthorizedReducer from './unauthorized-reducer';\n\nconst reducer = combineReducers({\n  unauthorized: unauthorizedReducer,\n  // ...other store slices (your resource reducers, etc.)\n});\n\nWith this in place, you have a slice of your state tree that will be true\nwhenever an unauthorized response is received.\nYou can use this value in your view layer to toggle the appearance of a modal,\nor some other notification, to let the user know that they need to log back in.\n"},"docs/recipes/user-feedback.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/user-feedback.html","title":"User Feedback","keywords":"","body":"User Feedback\nIt's important to provide a user with feedback of the status of CRUD operation\nrequests.

Think of these as guidelines, rather than rules set in\nstone. Different applications will require different user experiences.\nPending Requests\nYou should communicate to the user when a request is in flight. This lets them\nknow that the application is still processing the operation.\nThe getState method returns an object with\na pending property, which will be true whenever the associated request is in\nflight. You can use this to show a spinner, for instance. If you're using React,\nthis might look like:\nrender() {\n  const { state } = this.props;\n  const readStatus = getStatus(state, 'books.meta.24.readStatus');\n\n  return (\n    \n      {readStatus.pending && ()}\n    \n  );\n}\n\nA spinner is a common pattern for indicating that an operation is underway, but\nit doesn't work in every situation. For instance, you might know that the\nrequest will take awhile, such as large file uploads. In those situations, it\nmight make sense to use a different element, such a a progress bar, to represent\nthe progress of the request.\nRegardless of how you communicate the loading state, loading indicators should\nbe unobtrusive. Some applications will overlay the whole interface, or a large\nsection of the interface, with a spinner\nwhenever an action occurs. This prevents the user from taking any other\naction with the page while also hindering their ability to read content on the\npage, contributing to a terrible user experience.\nIn many situations, a better approach is to display a loading indicator nearby\nthe affected elements on the page. For instance, if the user is deleting a\nresource from a list of resources, then perhaps it makes sense for a spinner to\nbe displayed next to the resource's name. This allows the user to initiate\nmultiple delete requests at once, while keeping track of each their statuses\nindependently. It also doesn't interfere with any other content on the page.\nDisabling Interface Elements\nSometimes, it makes sense to disable aspects of an interface when a CRUD\nrequest is in flight. Always take a minimalist approach when it comes\nto disabling interface elements: disable as little as possible.\nA short list of situations where it might make sense to disable an element are:\n\nWhen a user clicks a button to delete a resource. It doesn't make sense to\nhave two delete requests for a resource in flight at once.\n\nWhen a user clicks a button to make a purchase.\n\nWhen a user clicks the \"create\" button to create a new resource.\n\n\nSometimes, developers go too far when they disable interface elements. For\ninstance, overing the whole page, or a large portion of the page, which a\nloading indicator effectively disables those regions.\nIf you're using React, an example code snippet of disabling a button is:\nrender() {\n  const { state } = this.props;\n  const readStatus = getStatus(state, 'books.meta.24.readStatus');\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n        Delete Book\n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\nFailed Requests\nWhen a request fails, there should be a human-readable message that states that\nthe request was unsuccessful. Unless your users are developers, error codes\nprobably won't be helpful to users. A message that simply says \"There was an\nerror with your request.\" can provide a better user experience than one that\nsays \"Error code 2603,\" even though it technically contains less information.\nI don't mean to convey that error codes aren't useful. They can be! Especially\nin logs and diagnostics. But always ask yourself if it makes sense to display\nthem to the user.\nIf you're able to convert an error code into a more specific, human-readable\nmessage (like \"You must provide an email address.\"), then that's even better.\nIn addition to an explanatory message, it sometimes makes sense to provide the\nuser with a link to attempt the operation again as part of the message. In\nReact, a typical error message might look like the following:\nrender() {\n  const { state } = this.props;\n  const readStatus = getStatus(state, 'books.meta.24.readStatus');\n\n  return (\n    \n      {readStatus.failed && (\n        \n          \n            There was an error fetching the book.\n          \n          \n            Retry.\n          \n          \n      )}\n    \n  );\n}\n\nUnauthorized Responses\nSome applications expire a user's session after a period of time. When that\noccurs, the user won't be able to perform any CRUD operations until they log\nback in.\nThere is a recipe that provides you\nwith a Boolean that is true whenever this happens. Once you have that value,\nyou can let the user know that they've been logged out.\nOne way to do this would be to open a modal letting them know what happened,\nand what they need to do. You can even make the modal have one button,\n\"Log in again.\" If you choose to use this method, be considerate of the fact\nthat a user may have been inputting data into a form. If you interrupt their\nworkflow like this, it's wise to save their work into local storage, and let\nthem know that when they log in, the information that they've entered won't be\nlost.\nIf you're using React, the code to do this may look like the following:\nrender() {\n  const { unauthorized } = this.props;\n\n  return (\n    \n      {unauthorized && ()}\n    \n  );\n}\n\nSuccessful Requests\nUsers typically know immediately when a read request succeeds because the data\nthat was fetched is displayed in the interface. For other requests,\nyou should provide some other indicator.\nSome examples of indicators include:\n\nA toast or notification that appears, stating that the operation succeeded.\n\nText appearing elsewhere on the interface, stating that the request succeeded.\nThis is frequently seen on account and settings pages when changes are made.\n\nIf a spinner is used for the loading state, it could be transformed into\na green checkmark, indicating success\n\n\nThere are many other ways to indicate success, as well.\nSuccess indicators follow a similar pattern to the other indicators if you're\nusing React. For instance:\nrender() {\n  const { state } = this.props;\n  const updateState = getStatus(state, 'books.meta.24.updateStatus');\n\n  return (\n    \n      {updateState.succeeded && ('Your settings have been updated')}\n    \n  );\n}\n\n"},"docs/extras/":{"url":"docs/extras/","title":"Ecosystem Extras","keywords":"","body":"Ecosystem Extras\nThe Redux Resource ecosystem provides bits of code that make working with the library even better.\n\nRedux Resource XHR\nRedux Resource Plugins\nRedux Resource Prop Types\n\n"},"docs/extras/redux-resource-xhr.html":{"url":"docs/extras/redux-resource-xhr.html","title":"Redux Resource XHR","keywords":"","body":"Redux Resource XHR\n\nRedux Resource provides a collection of action creators for Redux Resource\nActions. These action creators use a thin wrapper around the\nxhr library for making HTTP requests.\nMore information about understanding how to use these action creators can be\nfound in the CRUD Actions guide, as well as\nthe four guides for each CRUD operation:\n\nReading resources\nUpdating resources\nCreating resources\nDeleting resources\n\nThese action creators work well for endpoints that operate on a single resource\ntype. If your backend includes endpoints that involve more than one resource\ntype (such as including a primary resource and its related resources in a\nsingle GET request), then you will likely need to write custom action creators\nto handle those specific endpoints.\nA pattern that works well is to use these action creators for endpoints that\ntarget a single resource type, and then write custom action creators for more\ncomplex endpoints.\nInstallation\nInstall redux-resource-xhr from npm:\nnpm install redux-resource-xhr --save\nThen, import the pieces of the package that you need:\nimport { readResources } from 'redux-resource-xhr';\n\nUsage\nThis collection exports five action creators, one for each of the CRUD\noperations, and one generic one. It also exports the library that is used for\nmaking HTTP requests.\ncrudAction( options, [callback] )\nA generic action creator for performing CRUD operations.\nArguments\n\noptions (Object|Function): Options to configure the CRUD operation.\nIf a function is passed, it will be passed one argument: state, which is\nthe current state of the Redux store. Passing a function allows you to\nconfigure the action creator based on the state.\nAll of the options that you pass in will be included in the Actions that are\ndispatched. Because of this, all of\nthe CRUD Action options are supported, such\nas resourceName.\nThere are several additional options that can be used to configure the\nactions:\n\ndispatch: (Function) The dispatch function of a Redux store. If you're using\nredux-thunk), this will be the first\nargument of the thunk.\n\ncrudAction: (String) The CRUD operation being performed. One of \"create\",\n\"read\", \"update\", or \"delete\". This determines which\nCRUD Action types are dispatched.\n\nxhrOptions: (Object) Options to pass to the xhr library. You must pass\na a url (or uri) option. You will typically also want to pass\njson: true, which will serialize your request body into JSON, as well as\nparse the response body as JSON. For more, see the examples below and\nthe xhr documentation.\n\n[transformData]: (Function) An optional function to transform the data\nreceived by the server. It receives one argument, body, which is the\nresponse from the server, parsed as JSON. Return a transformed list of\nresources. This can be used to format the server response into a\nRedux Resource-compatible format. For more, see the guide on\nResources.\n\n\n\ncallback (Function, optional): This is called after the \"end\" action is\ndispatched for this CRUD action. It receives 3 arguments (err, res, body),\nwhich are the same arguments passed to the\nxhr\ncallback.\n\n\nReturns\n(XMLHttpRequest): An instance of a\nXMLHttpRequest.\nTypically, you'll use this object to abort the request (should you need to) by\ncalling myXhr.abort().\nExample\nimport { crudAction } from 'redux-resource-xhr';\nimport store from './store';\n\nconst xhrOptions = {\n  method: 'GET',\n  json: true,\n  url: '/books',\n  qs: {\n    user: 'someone@example.com'\n  }\n};\n\ncrudAction({\n  dispatch: store.dispatch,\n  crudAction: 'read',\n  resourceName: 'books',\n  request: 'getHomePageBooks',\n  list: 'homePageBooks',\n  mergeListIds: false,\n  xhrOptions\n});\n\ncreateResources( options, [callback] )\nA convenience wrapper for the crudAction action creator that passes these\noptions by default:\n{\n  crudAction: 'create',\n  xhrOptions: {\n    method: 'POST'\n  }\n}\n\nExample\nimport { createResources } from 'redux-resource-xhr';\nimport store from './store';\n\nconst newBook = {\n  title: 'My Name is Red',\n  releaseYear: 2004\n};\n\nconst xhrOptions = {\n  url: '/books',\n  json: newBook\n};\n\ncreateResources({\n  dispatch: store.dispatch,\n  resourceName: 'books',\n  request: 'createBooks',\n  xhrOptions\n});\n\nreadResources( options, [callback] )\nA convenience wrapper for the crudAction action creator that passes these\noptions by default:\n{\n  crudAction: 'read',\n  xhrOptions: {\n    method: 'GET'\n  }\n}\n\nExample\nimport { readResources } from 'redux-resource-xhr';\nimport store from './store';\n\nconst xhrOptions = {\n  url: '/books/1',\n  json: true\n};\n\n// This is a singular endpoint, so it returns just one resource.

It is a thin wrapper around the\nlibrary xhr, and supports all of the same\noptions and signatures.\nOn top of that, it adds two features:\n\nSupport for a qs option (similar to the request library).\n\nOmitting the callback will return a native\nPromise.\n\n\nExample\nimport { xhr } from 'redux-resource-xhr';\n\nconst booksSearch = xhr.get('/books', {\n  // Pass a `qs` option, and it will be stringified and appended to the URL\n  // for you\n  qs: {\n    bookName: 'brilliance of the moon'\n  },\n  json: true\n}, (err, res, body) => {\n  console.log('Got some books', body);\n});\n\n// Later, you can abort the request:\nbooksSearch.abort();\n\n// Omit a callback to get a native Promise. This can be useful sometimes, but the\n// tradeoff is that you cannot cancel Promises.\nxhr.get('/books/24')\n  .then(\n    (res) => console.log('got a book', res),\n    (err) => console.log('there was an error', err)\n  );\n\nTips\n\nA good pattern for using this collection is to make your own action creators\nthat \"wrap\" these action creators using\nredux-thunk. That way, your view layer\ndoesn't need to concern itself with all of the configuration necessary to use\nthese action creators. For instances, your application's read many action creator\nmay look like the following:\nimport { readResources } from 'redux-resource-xhr';\n\nfunction readManyBooks(pageNumber) {\n  return (dispatch) => {\n    const xhrOptions = {\n      method: 'GET',\n      json: true,\n      url: '/books',\n      qs: { pageNumber }\n    };\n\n    return readResources({\n      resourceName: 'books',\n      request: 'getHomePageBooks',\n      list: 'homePageBooks',\n      mergeListIds: false,\n      xhrOptions,\n      dispatch\n    });\n  };\n}\n\n\n\n"},"docs/extras/redux-resource-prop-types.html":{"url":"docs/extras/redux-resource-prop-types.html","title":"Redux Resource Prop Types","keywords":"","body":"Redux Resource Prop Types\n\nA collection of prop-types objects.\nInstallation\nInstall redux-resource-prop-types with npm:\nnpm install redux-resource-prop-types --save\nThen, import the prop types that you need:\nimport { resourcesPropType } from 'redux-resource-prop-types';\n\nUsage\nThere are four prop types.

There are\nsimilar projects that also aim to\nreduce Redux boilerplate, which are also worth your consideration.\nDoes this only work with React?\nNo. The only requirement is that you are using Redux, or a library that has a\nsimilar API to Redux.\nHow does this library handle immutable state?\nThis library uses shallow cloning for state tree updates. This has worked well\nfor us, even on medium-to-large sized applications.\nRedux Resource does not work well with libraries like\nImmutable.js, although we're open\nto adding support for Immutable if it doesn't bloat the library too much. If\nthis is something you're interested in,\nopen an issue and we\ncan talk more about it.\nDoes this only work with APIs that return data in a specific format?\nNo, this library is agnostic to the format that you receive data in. The only\nrequirement is that each resource that you pass into this library has an id\nattribute.\nWe understand that not every system stores its resources with an id attribute.\nFor instance, if you're working with a books resource, then it might instead\nhave an id attribute called bookId. In these situations, you will need to\nwrite a transform that maps that key to be id instead.\nFor more, refer to the Resources guide.\nDoes this work with a backend that adheres to a well-defined format, such as JSON API?\nYes, it does. You may want to write a plugin to handle\nsome advanced features provided by specifications such as JSON API, such as rich\nrelationship support.\nDoes this work with backends that are not strictly \"RESTful\"?\nYes. The only requirement is that the data returned can be reasonably mapped to\nthe concept of a \"resource.\" A resource, from this library's perspective, is\na JavaScript object with an id attribute.\nFor more on this, refer to the Resources guide.\nDoes Redux Resource handle forms, or client-side changes to data?\nThis library complements, but does not replace, solutions for managing forms\nand other ways to manipulate resource data on the client. Redux Resource\nworks will with any system for managing forms, such as local Component state,\nreact-redux-form,\nor redux-form.\n"},"docs/faq/state-tree.html":{"url":"docs/faq/state-tree.html","title":"State Tree","keywords":"","body":"State tree\nCan I store additional metadata for resources within meta?\nYou can, and we encourage it.

It can also be used to aggregate multiple request\nstatuses together.\nArguments\n\nstate (Object): Typically, the current state of the Redux store, but\nmore generally it can be any object that has a request status somewhere deeply\nnested within it.\n\nstatusLocation (String|Array): A single path that points to a request\nstatus within state. If you pass an array of status locations, then they\nwill be aggregated. For more on status locations and status aggregation, see\nthe Notes below.\n\n[treatNullAsPending] (Boolean): Whether or not a request status of NULL is\nto be considered as a pending request. Defaults to false. See Tips on\nwhen to use this.\n\n\nReturns\n(Object): An Object representing the status of this request for the\n  statusLocation. It has the following shape:\n  {\n    null: Boolean,\n    pending: Boolean,\n    failed: Boolean,\n    succeeded: Boolean\n  }\n\n  One of these values is always true, reflecting the value of the request\n  status. When treatNullAsPending is true, then request statuses that are\n  \"NULL\" will be returned as pending: true.\nNotes\nPassing more than one status location will aggregate the statuses. The rules of\naggregation work as follows:\n\nIf all of the requests are null, then the aggregate is null\nIf any of the requests are failed, then the aggregate is failed.\nIf no requests have failed, but some are pending, then the aggregate is pending.\nIf all requests have succeeded, then the aggregate has succeeded.\n\nA status location is a string that specifies a location of a request status in\nyour state tree. For instance \"books.meta.24.readStatus\" or\n\"books.requests.dashboardSearch.status\".\n\nKeep in mind that treatNullAsPending also works when aggregating.\n\nExamples\nIn this example, we pass a single status location:\nimport { getStatus } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nconst state = store.getState();\nconst bookDeleteStatus = getStatus(state, 'books.meta.23.deleteStatus');\n\nIn this example, we pass two locations:\nimport { getStatus } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nconst state = store.getState();\nconst bookReadStatus = getStatus(\n  state,\n  [\n    'articles.meta.23.readStatus',\n    'comments.requests.detailsRead.status'\n  ],\n  true\n);\n\nTips\n\nThe third argument, treatNullAsPending, is useful for requests that are made when\nyour components mount. The components will often render before the request\nbegins, so the status of these requests will be NULL. Passing treatNullAsPending\nwill consider these NULL states as pending: true.\n\nIf you're using React, we recommend computing your getStatus values in\nmapStateToProps, and then passing them in as props into your component. That\nway, you have access to this information in all of the lifecycle methods of\nyour component.\n\nThe first argument, state, doesn't always need to be the state of your\nRedux store. For instance, if you're using this method within your component's\nlifecycle methods, such as componentWillReceiveProps, you may instead pass\nit an object that is a subset of the state. This can be useful when you're\ncomparing a previous status against an upcoming status.\n\n\n"},"docs/api-reference/get-resources.html":{"url":"docs/api-reference/get-resources.html","title":"getResources","keywords":"","body":"getResources(state, resourceName, idsOrList)\nReturns an array of resources.\nArguments\n\nstate (Object): The current state of the Redux store.\n\nresourceName (String): The name of the resource.\n\nidsOrList (Array): An array of resource IDs.\n\n\nReturns\n(Array): An Array of resources.\nExample\nimport { getResources } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nconst state = store.getState();\n\n// Retrieve resources by an array of IDs\nconst bookSelection = getResources(state, 'books', [1, 12, 23]);\n\n// Retrieve resources by a list name\nconst bookSelection = getResources(state, 'books', 'mostPopular');\n\nTips\n\nYou don't always need to use this method to access resources.
